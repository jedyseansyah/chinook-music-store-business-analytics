# Chinook Music Store Business Analytics

## Highlight

This project analyzes sales at a music album company. The analysis was conducted using SQL, Pentaho Data Integration (PDI), and Tableau. The results of the analysis show that sales in 2021-2025 will fluctuate. There will be a decline in 2022-2023, while in 2024 & 2025 sales will begin to stabilize again. The analysis shows that prices between genres are uniform, so popularity is the main determinant of revenue. The Rock genre with Music playlists is the genre with the highest revenue. The best-selling album is Minha Historia with an even distribution across each album. The most popular artist is Iron Maiden with a significant difference. The majority of buyers are individual buyers (not companies), and the USA is the largest contributor to revenue.
